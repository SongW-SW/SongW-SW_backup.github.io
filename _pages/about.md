I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia, advised by Professor Jundong Li. And previously I received my B.E. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University.

My research interests include knowledge graphs and few-shot learning on graphs.
